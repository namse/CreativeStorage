
- Create class for storage service
  - class StorageService
  - methods
    - `writeFile(filename: string, file: Buffer): Promise<void>`
    - `readFile(filename: string): Promise<Buffer>`
    - `listFiles(): Promise<FileMetadata>`
- Use it instead of fs in api router
- Test all methods
  - Not method by method. You can test at once!
    - Coverage is important than number of test.
